# Welcome

Hi! Welcome to Henspace.com. This is just a portal pointing to a variety of
projects I'm working on. Feel free to take a look around.

# Games and apps

Most of my games are published on itch.io, so if you want to see what I've been working on pop over to [henspace on itch.io](https://henspace.itch.io).

# Drawings

If you're interested in what sort of things I draw, take a look at my other social media sites or my [blog](https://henspace.com).

# Webtoons comics

I've also been working on a number of comics which are all freely available at Webtoons.

# Too many owls: a children's story

This is a story for children up to about 3 or 4. It's free and slightly interactive.

It's also available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Are-there-many-owls-bears/dp/B08L8SNLX8) if you'd like to support my work. It's pretty much the same as the online version but it includes a similar story about some cute bears.
