# Welcome

Hi! Welcome to Henspace.com. This is just a portal pointing to a variety of
projects I'm working on. Feel free to take a look around.

## Portfolio

If you're interested in what sort of things I draw, there's a random selection in my portfolio.

## Webtoons comics

I've also been working on a number of comics which are all freely available at Webtoons.

## Too many owls: a children's story

This is a story for children up to about 3 or 4. It's free and slightly interactive.

It's also available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Are-there-many-owls-bears/dp/B08L8SNLX8) if you'd like to support my work. It's pretty much the same as the online version but it includes a similar story about some cute bears.
