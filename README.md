Hi!
I'm an illustrator and software developer working in the south of England.
Obviously, here on GitHub, I'm focused on software, but if you want to see other stuff I'm working on, get across to [henspace.com](https://henspace.com).

- ðŸ‘¦ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m currently working on [Text2Lesson](https://github.com/henspace/text2lesson). This is very much work-in-progress.
I'm not currently looking for collaborators, as this is a bit of a pet project at the moment. But who knows what the future holds ðŸ˜¬.
