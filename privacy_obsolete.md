# Henspace Obsolete Products Privacy

Some products that I developed have been removed from the Play store and are no longer available or supported. For convenience, if you still have these applications installed, you can find details of the advertising networks and privacy statements that would have applied when you first used the applications. Please note that this is historical information provided for reference purposes only; it does not reflect current data protection practices and links to third party sites are not maintained and may become broken over time.

## Automatic Data Collection and Advertising

We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Applications are being used and to provide information such as the frequency and duration of usage. We work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the applications. You should refer to the individual privacy policies of the advertising networks used.

The current advertising networks used are listed below:
