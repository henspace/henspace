Some products that I developed have been removed from the Play store and are no longer available or supported. For convenience, if you still have these applications installed, you can find details of the advertising networks and privacy statements that would have applied when you first used the applications. Please note that this is historical information provided for reference purposes only; it does not reflect current data protection practices and links to third party sites are not maintained and may become broken over time.
