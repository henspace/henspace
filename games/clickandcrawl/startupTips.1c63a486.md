The exploration of any dungeon is dangerous. Many an intrepid hero has died
within its dank, dark walls. The only way you can really learn about the dangers that lie ahead is to get in there and start exploring. 

On a scrap of vellum passed to you by the village elder are some notes that previous explorers have passed on to their successors.

- Click on people and objects. To interact you must be next to them. That means to their north, south, east or west &mdash; not diagonally.
- To manage your own inventory or cast spells, click on yourself.
- The more gold you send back to the townsfolk via the gold portals, the greater your reputation.
- Resting between dungeon floors can restore some health and remove the ongoing effects of poisons. You need one meal (food and drink) for a short rest, and three meals for a long rest.
- To use any spells you learn, you need to take a long rest so you can prepare them.
- Cantrips are quick magic. If you learn any, you can use them straight away.
- The little target icon at the bottom right of the map, centres the map on your hero. Drag the map to disable it; click it again to enable it.

Good luck! You're going to need it. Many brave explorers have died within these unforgiving walls, and
many more surely will.
