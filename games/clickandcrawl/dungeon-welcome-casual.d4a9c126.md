# Beware all who enter here.

You enter the dungeon for a quick exploration to allow you to 
assess what dangers might be present before you start a full adventure. In this reconnaissance mission, your progress will not be recorded in the dungeon's annals, and all achievements will be lost to history at the end.

You're on the first floor of the dungeon. Water trickles down the
walls to mix with fungus and slime that coat the stone floor.
There is a smell of death hanging in the air and clinging to the back of your throat.
