# Beware all who enter here.

You secretly slip into the dungeon to see if the stories about what the crumbling
walls contain are true. You haven't told anyone about this, so even if you manage
to send back gold to the townsfolk via the dwarven portals, no one will know it
was you. No one will sing about your exploits, no one will sing ballads about
your heroism and no one will record your name in the Hall of Fame. You are
destined to be forgotten.

You're on the first floor of the dungeon. Water trickles down the
walls to mix with fungus and slime that coat the stone floor.
There is a smell of death hanging in the air and clinging to the back of your throat.
