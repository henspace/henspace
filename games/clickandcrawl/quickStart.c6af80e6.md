# Click and Crawl quick start

**Click and Crawl** is a casual old-school dungeon crawler. Your starting
hero is created automatically, so just click **Start&nbsp;adventure** and
see how much gold you can make. The success of your exploration is judged by how
much gold you manage to send back to the townsfolk via the gold portals located
within the dungeon.

Have a look at **Getting started** for basic guidance on moving and interacting.

If you're having problems, check out the **Help** section.

+ If you click **Start&nbsp;adventure** or **Continue&nbsp;adventure**, your progress is saved when you complete a room, and if you send back more gold than previous explorers, your adventure will be recorded in the **Hall of Fame**.
+ If you click **Casual&nbsp;exploration**, nothing is saved! Your progress is lost, and there is no chance to make it into the **Hall of Fame**.
