# Click and Crawl Help

Oh, no! You need help? In the true spirit of the dungeon explorer, it's normally
best to start a few adventures, die a bit, learn a bit, and then start a new
adventure. If you really, really want extra guidance, there's a little more information
below.

## Disturbed ground

Many items are hidden where the ground has been disturbed. If you look carefully,
you should be able to see the subtle evidence of where the flagstones have been
disturbed. Everything is visible; there's never any need to randomly click and
search ... honest.

## Disengaging

When you are fighting an opponent, you can disengage from the fight. To disengage,
just move away by two or less tiles. Your hero will back away, and the opponents
you were fighting will not immediately follow you.

## Resting

Resting is important but takes time. To represent the passage of time, the concept of meals is used. A meal comprises one drink and one food item.  A short rest uses one meal, and a long rest, which is equivalent to twenty-four hours, uses three. You will need to take a long rest after a certain number of short ones. The number depends on your hero's level.

Resting takes place in the relative safety of the stairs between floors.

## Magic

Your character may start with some cantrips or spells, so click on your hero
and check out the **Magic** section. 

- Cantrips are quick incantations that can be cast at will whenever you want.
- Spells are more complex magic and have to be prepared after a long rest before they can be used. You might actually start with a few ready-prepared spells.
- To cast a spell or cantrip, click on your hero and select **Cast&nbsp;spells and cantrips**.
- Remember! Magic can act over great distances, so instead of charging in with a weapon, you can try to keep weaker heroes away from monsters and use magic instead. ![](http://ASSET_URL_GUIDE_CAST)

The magic system in **Click&nbsp;and&nbsp;Crawl** has been simplified from normal DnD rules. Casting a spell utilises some of your casting power. If you run out of power, you'll need to take a long rest to recover it.

Different spells and cantrips spread across the dungeon in different ways based
on their **Direction** trait. If magic has no direction, it acts on the hero.

- North-south-east-west: the magic affects tiles in the four compass directions but not diagonally.
- Radial: the magic affects tiles in a circle centred on the hero. This includes diagonals.

You cannot select the target; this is done automatically.

## Monster movements

Monsters will not walk over items such as manhole covers or disturbed ground, for example. They will also avoid corpses. You can use this to your advantage.

## Keys

Keys may be hidden in the dungeon under manhole covers, trap doors, under disturbed ground, or can even be carried by some monsters.

## Organic adversaries

Organic adversaries grow across the dungeon floor. They only affect you if you linger in them, so you're safe while moving but in trouble if you end your turn in them. Sometimes you'll have no choice.
