# Click and Crawl Help

Oh, no! You need help? In the true spirit of the dungeon explorer, it's normally
best to start a few adventures, die a bit, learn a bit, and then start a new
adventure. If you really want a bit more guidance, there's a little information
below.

## Resting

Resting is important and takes time. To mimic the passage of time, meals are used. A meal comprises one drink and one food item.  A short rest uses one meal, and a long rest, which is equivalent to 24 hours, uses three. You will need to take a long rest after a certain number of short ones. The number depends on your hero's level.

Resting take place in the relative safety of the stairs between floors.

## Magic

Your character may start with some cantrips or spells, so click on your hero
and check out the **Magic** section. 

- Cantrips are quick incantations that can be cast at will whenever you want.
- Spells are more complex magic and have to be prepared after a long rest before they can be used. You might actually start with a few ready-prepared spells.
- To cast a spell, click on your hero and select **Cast&nbsp;spell**.

The magic system in **Click&nbsp;and&nbsp;Crawl** has been simplified from normal DnD rules. Casting a spell utilises some of your casting power. If you run out of power, you need to take a long rest to recover it.

Different spells and cantrips spread across the dungeon in different ways based
on their **Direction** trait. If magic has no direction, it acts on the caster.

- North-south-east-west: the magic affects tiles in the four compass directions but not diagonally.
- Radial: the magic affects tiles in a circle centred on the hero. This includes diagonals.

You cannot select the target; this is done automatically.

## Monster movements

Monsters will not walk over hidden artefacts such as manhole covers. You can use this to your advantage.

## Keys

Keys may be hidden under manhole covers and trap doors or carried by some monsters.

## Organic adversaries

Organic adversaries grow across the dungeon floor. They only affect you if you linger in them.
So you're okay to move across them, but in trouble if you end your turn on them. Sometimes you'll have to.
