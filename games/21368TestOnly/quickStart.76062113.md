# Click and Crawl quick start

**Click and Crawl** is a casual old-school dungeon crawler. Your starting
character is created automatically, so just click **Play&nbsp;adventure** and
see how much gold you can make. Make more gold than a previous adventure and your
adventure will be saved as the best.

To interact with people and objects, you must be next to them. You can only interact
with things to your north, south, east or west -- not diagonally.

To interact, just click on the object or monster.

Tip: some objects might be hidden, but they will be highlighted if you are in a position
to interact with them.

Explore the dungeon, do what you need to do, find the exit and move on to the next
room.

+ If you click **Play&nbsp;adventure** your progress is saved when you complete a room, and if you collect more gold than ever before, you achievement is saved as the **Best adventure**.
+ If you click **Play&nbsp;casual**, nothing is saved -- no progress and no best
adventure.

More detailed guidance is in the **Help** guide, but the best guide is just to get
in there and play.
