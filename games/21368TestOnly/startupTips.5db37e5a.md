The exploration of any dungeon is dangerous. Many an intrepid hero has died
within its dank, dark walls. The only way you can really learn about the dangers that lie ahead is to get in there and start exploring. 

On a scrap of vellum passed to you by the village elder, are some notes that previous explorers have passed on to their successors.

- To interact with people and objects, that includes fighting and trading, you must be next to them. That means to their north, south, east or west -- not diagonally.
- Slime and other organic growths will only affect you if you linger in them. You can always run through them unharmed.
- Your masters are expecting a return on their investments, so keep your eye out for gold. The more gold and experience you can gain, the greater your reputation will be.
- To use any spells you learn, you'll need to rest between dungeon floors and eat 3 meals each comprising a drink and rations.
- Cantrips are quick magic. If you learn any, you can use them straight away.

Good luck. You're going to need it.
