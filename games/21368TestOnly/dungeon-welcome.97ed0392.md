# Beware all who enter here.

Welcome, if that be the word, to the dungeon of Klastok Kremblin. Built at the time of the great planetary schism, the dungeon has become home to creatures from all realms of the kingdom. Great dangers exist within the granite walls, but great riches also.

You intend to find the Iron Goblet of Chreftyitees, supposedly lost just after the great schism. Legends tell that drinking from the goblet will result in the healing of the schism and a return of balance to the universe.

You're on the first floor of the dungeon. Water trickles down the
walls to mix with fungus and slime that coat the stone floor.
There is a smell of death hanging in the air and clinging to the back of your throat.
