# Click and Crawl quick start

**Click and Crawl** is a casual old-school dungeon crawler. Your starting
character is created automatically, so just click **Start&nbsp;adventure** and
see how much gold you can make. The success of your exploration is judged by how
much gold you manage to send back to the townsfolk via the gold portals located
within the dungeon.

To interact with people and objects, you must be next to them. You can only interact
with things to your north, south, east or west -- not diagonally.

To interact, just click on the object or monster.

Tip: some objects might be hidden, but they will be highlighted if you are in a position to interact with them.

Explore the dungeon, do what you need to do, find the exit and move on to the next floor.

+ If you click **Start&nbsp;adventure** or **Continue&nbsp;adventure** your progress is saved when you complete a room, and if you send back more gold than previous explorers, your adventure will be recorded in the **Hall of Fame**.
+ If you click **Casual&nbsp;exploration**, nothing is saved &mdash; no progress and no best adventure.

More detailed guidance is in the **Help** guide, but the best guide is just to get
in there and explore.
