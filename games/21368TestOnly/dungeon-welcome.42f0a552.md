# Beware all who enter here.

The kingdom of the Three Golden Towers has fallen under the control of undead
forces released by necromancer Kriptor FallenSword, a power-crazed rogue mage
from the wetlands.

The people in your town are suffering worse than most under this evil regime as
the presence of the undead and stench of death cause their crops to fail and
animals to waste and die. Their only hope of salvation is to raise an army of
mercenaries and monster hunters who can rid the kingdom from Kriptor's undead
minions. But armies cost money and your townsfolk have none!

Legends tell of an ancient dungeon, holding vast riches and gold, but also
fearsome creatures and dangers. Originally built by the dwarves of the Black Dragon
Mountains, the dungeon contains gold portals for transferring the dwarves minings
up to the surface.

You have agreed to enter the dungeon and send back as much gold as you can to
help your fellow townsfolk raise an army and free the Three Gold Towers from the
curse that blights the land.

You're on the first floor of the dungeon. Water trickles down the walls to mix
with fungus and slime that coat the stone floor. There is a familiar smell of
death hanging in the air and clinging to the back of your throat.
