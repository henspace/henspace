# Beware all who enter here.

The kingdom of the Three Golden Towers has fallen under the control of undead
forces released by necromancer Kriptor Fallensword, a power-crazed rogue mage
from the wetlands.

The people in your town are suffering worse than most under his evil regime, as
the presence of the undead and stench of death cause their crops to fail and
animals to waste and die. The people's only hope of salvation is to raise an army of
mercenaries and monster-hunters who can rid the kingdom from Fallensword's undead
minions. But armies cost money and your fellow townsfolk have none!

Legends tell that the ancient dwarven dungeon on the outskirts of the town holds vast riches and gold, but also fearsome creatures and dangers. Originally built by the dwarves of the Black Dragon
Mountains, the dungeon allegedly contains gold portals for transferring the dwarves' minings
up to the surface.

You have agreed to enter the dungeon and send back, via these portals, as much
gold as you can to help your fellow townsfolk raise an army and free the Three
Golden Towers from the curse that blights the land.

You're on the ground floor of the dungeon. Water trickles down the walls to mix
with the fungus and slime that coat the stone floor. There is a familiar smell
of death hanging in the air and clinging to the back of your throat.
