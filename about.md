# About Henspace

Hi!

I'm an illustrator and software developer working in the south of England. Most of my artwork starts with either traditional or digital pen and ink and is then digitally coloured.

The illustrations tend to take a slightly sideways look at the subject to provide a less obvious view point.

I also work on some open-source software projects. If that's the sort of thing you're into, pop over to [Henspace @ GitHub](https://github.com/henspace).
