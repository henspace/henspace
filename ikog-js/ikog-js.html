<p>I'm afraid that iKog-js has reached the end of its life and will be closing down at the end of September 2016. This is due to a number of api changes that will be necessary in order to keep it operational. If you are a user of iKog-js, please accept my apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p><b>Please ensure that you move your data to another task management system before September.</b></p>
