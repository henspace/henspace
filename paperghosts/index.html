            <p>The game that neither sucks nor blows ... or does it?</p>

            <p>Suck up the  friendly ghosts with your vacuum pumps. But watch out for those evil ones. Catch those and all your hard work will count for nothing.</p>
            <p>Starting very gently, the beginning should be a breeze... but beware! Catching those guys in time will become more and more challenging. But don't worry; I have faith in you.</p>
            <p>This is the simplest, and most frustrating chance you'll ever have to capture these pesky paper ghosts.</p>

            <p>Featuring a unique suck-blow mechanism, the game is designed to be extremely quick to pick up with the simple challenge of racing through as many levels as you can. Fail and you start the race again.</p>

            <p>Paper Ghosts is no mind-stretching, brain-enhancing experience; this is just simple fun designed to shorten that underground journey or to keep you going while the rain pours down and the bus still hasn't arrived.</p>
